        Core mechanics:
    </h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to racing games, speed is the key factor. The faster the game play is, the more excitement and interesting
        the game will be and it will be a challenge for the player to control
        the vehicle and win the game by, to compete with the other 5
        opponents that are controlled by computer in a racing tournament, the player’s goal is to get to the
        destination as soon as possible while trying to avoid bumping to other cars or road object, the final score
        will be posted according to the finishing position, numbers of bumps and the time.

        This game has some other core mechanics with some other features as well. The racing track will be consists of single road.
        There will be countdown before starting the race. Then two moudule will work, First part is the Game Logic Generator which calculate the
        logic of this game, such as to detect bumps to obstacle, speed control based on keyboard input, opponents
        control and road generation, and this module is based on software. The second part is the Screen
        Rendering Module, we adopt the Sprite Graphics technique to decompose the display screen into 7 layers,
        which will be explained in derails in later section. The last part is the Audio Module which generate the
        proper sound under the control of game logic.
